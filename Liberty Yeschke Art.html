							<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
							<p> I am a native Texan, and grew up mainly around the Texas Hill Country. My interest in the fine arts and design only grew throughout the years, and before I knew it, I was attending West Texas A&amp;M University for their Graphic Design program. During my time in the program, I have learned much about how to create and enhance designs to not only draw people in, but to inspire them to become the best version of themselves that they could possibly be. Although I am still an amateur graphic designer, I firmly believe in the importance and value of hard work and determination, and look forward to every opportunity I have to learn something new! I love working with many types of creative people, and always appreciate what ideas others bring to the table during collaborative projects. I enjoy my daily cup of coffee, and love finding inspiration in the everyday beauty of life. </p>

							<h2>Studio Work</h2>
							<p>In the world that revolves itself around technology, art can also be heavily focused on the digital side of things. Luckily, fine art is still ever present, and many people such as myself, enjoy practicing traditional forms of art every once in a while. I began my own interest in fine art through drawing and painting, and love to continue to see what the paintbrush holds for the day!

							<h2>Additional Work</h2>
							<p>I am mainly self-taught, excluding the limited training and lessons that I have learned while in my college's art program. But no matter! I love to create, and with that includes many different types of mediums and tools that I like to use, both digital and traditional. Presented below, please feel free to view my various works that I have completed over the past year and a half!</p>

All of the proceeds from the auction were donated to the CASA project; a very awesome organization that helps foster children find their forever homes. </p>
